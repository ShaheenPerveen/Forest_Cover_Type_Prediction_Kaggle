Used cartographic variables to classify forest categories for a given 30 x 30 meter cell

- Applied regression analysis to determine the statistical significance of features to be used for the classification of forest cover type of an area

- Performed processing of data and feature selection using EDA, Correlation Matrix, Chi square test and ANOVA to train the model

- Applied Gradient Boosting Method for classification, tuned parameters of gbm model to obtain training and test accuracy of 74% and 67% 

- Improved train and test accuracy when compared to gradient boosting model to 82.5% and 81.8% using Random Forest with 2000 trees
